### Switch To Windows Developer Mode

We need to switch to developer mode in windows to make some changes to the current shell.

1. Go to Settings > Update and Security > For developers ( From Sidenav).

2. Select the Developer Mode Option and Press Yes !


![hyper-1.webp](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603104763583/V-JXlLyYC.webp)

3. After the necessary components, you'll need to restart your computer.

4. Once your Computer Reboots, open Control Panel.

#### Setup Windows Subsystem For Linux

5. Click on Programs

![hyper-3.webp](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603104836341/0ggS08UqP.webp)

7. Check the Windows Subsystem for Linux option and Press Ok.


![hyper-4.webp](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603104972300/ClnBkcB-8.webp)

8. Once the components are installed on your computer, click the Restart Now button to complete the task.

After your computer restarts, you will notice that Bash will not appear in the "Recently Added" list of apps, this is because Bash isn't actually installed yet. Let's do it now.

#### Install Ubuntu From App Store

9. Go to Windows App Store and Search for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS


![hyper-5.webp](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603104963818/MAS2fLqNg.webp)


10. Open start, do a search for Ubuntu and press Enter.

11. Create a new Unix User and Password, This account doesn't have to be the same as your Windows Account. Enter the username in the required field and press Enter( you can't use the username "admin")


![hyper-6.webp](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603104990007/qocIXE8yz.webp)

12. Done. Now you can use the bash commands in the Ubuntu Bash Shell.

(Tip: In ubuntu bash you can directly move to your Windows Folders using :  `cd \mnt\c`)

#### Install Hyper Terminal

To use all the customizations, we require a terminal that supports them. So let's install Hyper Terminal, which is built upon Javascript.


![hyper-7.webp](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603105003031/xmfBLkezy.webp)

Setup Hyper terminal to use ZSH

After you installed Hyper Terminal open %USERPROFILE%/.hyper.js config file and replace line:

```sh
shell: '',
```

with

```sh
shell: 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\bash.exe',
```

Now each time when you will open hyper terminal itâ€™s will be use zsh as default shell environment.

#### Install ZSH Shell

```sh
sudo apt-get install zsh
```
and open bashrc using nano editor

```sh
nano ~/.bashrc`
```

add

```sh
if [ -t 1 ]; then
exec zsh
fi
```

Open your terminal and type :

and search for the line for the theme and replace it with the theme you want to use:

## Install Spaceship Theme

```sh
git clone https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt.git "$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/spaceship-prompt"
```


![hyper-13.webp](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603105073211/C76mTZQqD.webp)

Now Symlink spaceship-prompt

```sh
ln -s "$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/spaceship-prompt/spaceship.zsh-theme" "$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/spaceship.zsh-theme"
